# MCL86jr Accelerator Board

This board is a drop-in replacement for the 8088 CPU inside of the PCjr.  It utilizes a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA and 512KB of SRAM.

The CPU core is the MCL86 and can be run in cycle accurare mode as well as non-cycle accurate which allows the PCjr to run 4X faster than an IBM PC and 20% faster than the IBM PC AT!

The board schematic and layout were done using KiCad and all of the development files are in the PCBA directory. The board was manufacured and assembled by PCBWay.
